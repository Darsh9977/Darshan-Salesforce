Sandboxes

Salesforce has four types of sandboxes:-

1.Developer :-
A sandbox for a single developer to code and test changes in isolation. It includes a copy of the production organization's metadata, but no data. 
Developer sandboxes are refreshed daily.

2.Partial Copy :-
A sandbox that includes a replica of the production organization's configuration and a sample of its data. It can be used for QA tasks like user 
acceptance testing, integration testing, and training.

3.Full :-
A sandbox that's an exact replica of the production organization, including all data. It's intended for testing and provides the same data storage 
as the production organization.

4.Developer Pro :-
A type of developer sandbox with more storage capacity.
Salesforce sandboxes are isolated areas for making changes without affecting the live Salesforce system. They contain all the configuration, 
customization, apps, and code (metadata) that have been made to the production environment. Some sandbox types can also contain some or all 
of the production data.
